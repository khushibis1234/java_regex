18.5 <= BMI < 24.9: Normal weight
25 <= BMI < 29.9: Overweight
BMI >= 30: Obesity


Question 3: Leap Year Checker

Create a program that asks for the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) and then greets the user accordingly. For example, "Good morning!" if the time is morning.



Question 5: Menu Selection
Design a simple restaurant menu system that takes a customer's choice (1-3) and displays the selected food item and its price. Use if-else if-else statements.


Question 6: Temperature Converter
Write a Java program to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program should ask the user for the input temperature and the unit (C or F) and provide the converted temperature.



Question 7: Number Comparison
Create a program that takes two numbers as input and uses if-else if-else statements to determine and print which number is greater or if they are equal.


Question 8: Ticket Booking System
Design a ticket booking system for a cinema that calculates the ticket price based on the age of the customer. Children (age < 12) get a 50% discount, while seniors (age >= 65) get a 30% discount.


Question 9: Letter Grade Calculator
Write a program that accepts a student's score as input and calculates their letter grade using if-else if-else statements. Consider the standard letter grading system (A, B, C, D, F).


Question 10: Vowel or Consonant Checker
