1)
What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

JDk=>
1)Java Development Kit 
2)it is used for software development.
3)jre+toolkit

JRE=>
1)Java runtime environment
2)it gives environment to code to run easily.
3)jvm+library

JVM=>
1)java virtual vachine
2)it is used for resuibilty of code
3)internal functionality of java--class loader, bytecodeverifier, interpretor,garbage collector.

2)
What are the features of Java Programming Language?
simple
object-oriented
portable
robust
architecural neutral
platform-independent
multithreading
distributed
dyanamic

3)
What do you understand by Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
java virtual machine
It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).

4)
What is the difference between a class and an object?
A class is blueprint or a template that defines the properties of behaviour and object.
An object is an instance of class that provide value. 

5)
What are Javaâ€™s primitive data types?
int 
char
float
long
short
double
boolean



6)
Explain the concept of the main() method in Java.

public static void main(String[]args)
public:access modifier
class:
void:return type
main:class name
String:r
[]:array
args:argument

7)
What is Java?
java is high level object oriented programming language.java is robust language and more secure language.
it is the combination of class and object.
class:set of templates
object:real word entity

8)
What are the different types of variables in Java?
local variable
private instance variable

9)
What is the significance of the boolean data type in Java?
condition declration :is it true or false?

10)
What are the different types of operators in Java?
arithmetic operator
assignment operator
relational operator
logical operator
ternanry opeartor

11)
What are logical operators in Java?
&&
||

12)
Explain the difference between float and double in Java.
float provide decial value 0.3f
double also denotes decimal value 0.55d but it stores large value in compare to float.

13)
Explain the difference between assignment operator and comparison operator in Java.
assignment operator:to assign values +-/*%
comparison operator :to compare =>, =< , == ,!=, > , <

14)
What are the default values of the different primitive data types in Java?

byte: 0
short: 0
int: 0
long: 0L
float: 0.0f
double: 0.0d
char: '\u0000'(unicode)
boolean: false

15)
How do relational operators work in Java?
==
=>
<=
!=
>
<

16)
What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
oops is object poriented programming language, and it is also known as paradignm.
paradignm=to perform specific task.

17)
What are the main principles of OOP?
encapsulation
inheritance
polymorphism
abstraction

18)
What is a class in Java?
variables that hold data and state of an object.
19)
What is the difference between a class and an object?
class:it is known as a template
object:real word entity

20)
Can you explain the concept of method overloading?
number of parameters is change 

21)
Can you explain the concept of method overriding?
class name same method name different

22)
What is an interface?

23)
What is aggregation?

24)
What is the difference between aggregation and composition?


25)
What are design patterns?
Creational Patterns: Focus on how objects are created. Examples: Singleton, Factory Method.

Structural Patterns: Deal with object composition and class relationships. Examples: Adapter, Decorator.

Behavioral Patterns: Concerned with object interactions and responsibilities. Examples: Observer, Strategy.

26)
How do you achieve polymorphism in Java?
method overriding
method overloading


27)
What are static methods and static variables?
A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to any specific instance of the class. It can be called on the class itself rather than on instances of the class.

A static variable, also known as a class variable, is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It belongs to the class itself, rather than to any specific instance of the class.

28)
What is the difference between a default constructor and a parameterized constructor?
default provides as a default value of constructor
in parameterised developer provide variales

29)What is the role of constructors in a class?
Constructors are used to set initial values for the fields of an object. They ensure that the object starts its life in a consistent and valid state.


30)What is the Singleton pattern?
System.out.println();
